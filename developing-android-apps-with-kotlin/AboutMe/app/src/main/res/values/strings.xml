    <string name="bio"> Hi there, my name is Rui.
    \n\n I am dedicated to become a Googler in the neat future.
        \n\n I\'m learning for the necessary knowledge to build my first Android App.
        \n\n I got my first Bachelor\'s degree in Accounting where I developed my critical thinking
        skills and data sensitivity. During my Master\'s degree in Management Information Systems,
        I gradually converted my career path from business to technology. And now I\'ve decided to
        pursue a second Bachelor\'s degree in Computer Science to further improve my technical
        skills while preparing to become a Googler.
